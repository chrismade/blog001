agile projects are trendy - however, there was a missing piece - at least for me. When I learnt about "agile" and why this is better in some cases compared to traditional project management I heart the phrase "autonomy, mastery and purpose" a lot but I could not see any context. If you felt the same - here comes the solution.

## A word of warning - this page may violate my data privacy policy

Writing these blog postings I will also test the features of this system (netlify) - and on this post I will try the youtube widget - not knowing how exactly it is implemented. 

It is my strong believe that a visit on this website is just between you and me - there should no one else - that's usually much easier said than done - because this website is hosted on github - which is now (becoming) a Microsoft company - but their terms of use seem to be save, at least in the version as of this writing (August 2018) - so unless I can run the whole blog on my own arm-powered server it might still be a good compromise.

That situation changes when google comes into the scene - in their terms of use everyone can read clearly that they use and share all collected data for almost any purpose - very beautiful words describing something which is in reality pretty ugly - no much people care about this, but I do - it has become a little bit better when [GDPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation) had become effective on May 25, 2018 - however, I would like to give a warning to everyone \_beforehand\_ so that you can decide on your own whether would would like to continue or not - 

Depending on how the youtube widget has been technically implemented this will be possible or not - let's see...

## Understanding Autonomy, Mastery and Purpose

If you research hard enough we will come across author [Daniel H Pink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_H._Pink) who wrote a number of books. In his book "Drive" these three terms are explained in detail - and you may also find a fast-track version in this video:

A recording - which has been animated later on - it is definitely worth spending 10mins 47sec to understand what is the "idea" and what has been tested - and how - and why this is also the foundation of agile working as we know it today. Enjoy

## conclusion - the YouTube video widget

Unfortunately the Widget violates the data privacy policy because it includes the youtube javascript into this page - like it or not - your visit is shared with google/youtube and even worse, if you are logged in to youtube in another browser tab or have a valid cookie for youtube then it will make a connection - and you will see soon more recommendations of similar videos when you visit youtube next time.

Also the widget itself needs rework - as it shows only a part of the video - at least on my screen resolution - and the player controls are hidden - 

So the widget - is basically working - but with serious flaws
